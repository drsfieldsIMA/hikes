            <h2> Rejuvenate. Revitalize. Recycle</h2>
                <p>Sustainable tourism is important to us. Our world has amazing natural resources, and it is important that future generations can enjoy them as well. Not only do we want to ensure we donâ€™t damage natural resources and local communities, but we want to work together to help them flourish.</p>
  
            <h3>Ethical travel </h3>
                 <p>Our trips are planned with both environmental and cultural sustainability in mind, with the goal of leaving the smallest ecological footprint on the hiking area. Participants are expected to respect their hiking trail and behave accordingly.</p>
  
            <h4 class="black">Local connections</h4>
                 <p>Adventure Trails works closely with local organizations to ensure that much of the profit goes back to the local communities. This may be in the form of infrastructure and trail maintenance to supporting local businesses and communities.</p>
  
            <h5>Respect for nature</h5>
                 <p>Many of our hikes include extra activities such as bird watching and short courses on edible local plants. </p>
  
            <h6>Culture</h6>
                 <p>In the interest of cultural exchange and sustainability Adventure Trails also includes cultural activities, which include experiences of various local customs, dress, theatre, dance, and music. </p>
